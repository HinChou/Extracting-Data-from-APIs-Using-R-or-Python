Example: LinkedIn

Step 1 -  Create an application, Configuring your LinkedIn application:

Get client_id=XXX & client_secret=XXX

Set up OAuth 2.0 
Authorized Redirect URLs: (As same as Default "Accept" Redirect URL and Default "Cancel" Redirect URL) 
https://YourLinkedinURL/auth/callback
Eg: https://www.linkedin.com/in/data-science/auth/callback


Step 2  -  Request an Authorization Code:

Put the following url to your browser:
https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=XXX&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com/in/data-science/auth/callback&state=XXX&scope=r_basicprofile

Clicking on the "Allow Access" button and will redirect to:
www.XXX.com

Attached to the redirect_uri will be two important URL arguments that you need to read from the request:

code  -  The OAuth 2.0 authorization code.
state  -  A value used to test for possible CSRF attacks.

Save the code:
code=XXX


Step 3  -  Exchange Authorization Code for an Access Token:

Send a Post request. You Can use: http://requestmaker.com
#############
Request URL:
https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken

Request Headers:
Header: Content-Type
Value:application/x-www-form-urlencoded


Request Data:
grant_type=authorization_code&code=XXX&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com/in/data-science/auth/callback&state=XXX&client_id=XXX&client_secret=XXX
#####################

Result:
{"access_token":"XXX","expires_in":"5184000000"}
